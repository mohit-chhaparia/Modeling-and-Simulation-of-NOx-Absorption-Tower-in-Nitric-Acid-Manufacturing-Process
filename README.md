# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-NOx-Absorption-Tower-in-Nitric-Acid-Manufacturing-Process

The main aim of this project is to develop a mathematical model of the NOx absorption tower in Nitric Acid Manufacturing Process. Operating pressure and temperature, inlet gas composition and desired acid outlet concentration are the chief parameters that affect the number of trays required. We have developed a code in Scilab which can be used to find the weight fraction of acid formed on each tray in the absorption column, assuming constant temperature and pressure throughout the column.
